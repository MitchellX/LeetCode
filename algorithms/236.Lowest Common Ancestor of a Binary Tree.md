### 236.Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

​	Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given the following binary tree: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

 

**Note:**

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

#### 解析

注意，若p和q中有一个为父节点，则一定是从上到下先遍历到的。

#### 代码

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    //该函数有父节点则返回父节点，否则返回匹配到的p或者q
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(!root) return nullptr;
        if(root==p||root==q) return root;
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left,p,q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right,p,q);
        //说明两边均有匹配的节点
        if(left&&right)
        {
            return root;
        }
        //否则返回不为空的结点
        return left?left:right;
    }
};
```
