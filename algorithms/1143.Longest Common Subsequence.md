### 1143.Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A *subsequence* of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A *common subsequence* of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

#### 解析

最长公共子序列。用dp求解。设dp\[i+1\]\[j+1\]为序列1第i+1位和序列2第j+1位之前的最长公共子序列。动态规划方程为：

```c++
dp[i][j] = 0 ,i==j
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]+1 , s1[i]==s2[j]
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1],dp[i-1][j]), s1[i]!=s2[j]
```

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        if(text1.size()==0||text2.size()==0) return 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(text1.size()+1,vector<int>(text2.size()+1,0));
        for(int i=0;i<text1.size();++i)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<text2.size();++j)
            {
                if(text1[i]==text2[j])
                {
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j]+1;
                }
                else
                {
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i][j+1],dp[i+1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[text1.size()][text2.size()];
    }
};
```
