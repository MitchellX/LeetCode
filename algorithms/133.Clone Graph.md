### 133.Clone Graph

Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

 

**Example:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/19/113_sample.png)

```
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.

```

 

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Simple_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node *p* has node *q* as neighbor, then node *q* must have node *p* as neighbor too.
4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

#### 解析

简单无向图，不存在值重复的结点，使用DFS遍历整张图，进行深拷贝。

#### 代码

```c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if(node==nullptr) return nullptr;
        unordered_map<int, Node*> MyMap;
        Node* res=cloneGraph(node, MyMap, nullptr);
        return res;
    }
    //front为前一个遍历的结点
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node, unordered_map<int, Node*>& MyMap, Node* front)
    {
        if(node==nullptr) return nullptr;
      //注意以下两行的目的是将最后一个遍历的结点的vector中的node*指向第一个遍历的结点
        auto it = MyMap.find(node->val);
        if(it!=MyMap.end()) return it->second;
        Node* Head = new Node(node->val, node->neighbors);
        if(Head==nullptr) return node;
        MyMap.insert(make_pair(Head->val,Head));
        if(!front) front = Head;
        for(int i=0;i<Head->neighbors.size();++i)
        {
          	//类似于双向链表，将指针指向前一个结点
            if(Head->neighbors[i]&&Head->neighbors[i]->val==front->val)
            {
                Head->neighbors[i] = front;
              	//continue避免了重复访问结点
                continue;
            }
            Head->neighbors[i]=cloneGraph(Head->neighbors[i], MyMap, Head);
        }
        return Head;
    }
};
```
