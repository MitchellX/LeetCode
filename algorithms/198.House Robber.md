### 198.House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

#### 解析

DFS会超时，用DP来做，DP设F(N)为第N位的最多抢劫钱数，则DP方程为：

```
F(N) = max(F(N-1), F(N-2)+nums[N])
```

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n_1 = 0, n_2 = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();++i)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
            {
                n_2 = max(n_1, n_2+nums[i]);
            }
            else
            {
                n_1 = max(n_2, n_1+nums[i]);
            }
        }
        return max(n_1,n_2);
    }
};
```
