### 123.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note: **You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

#### 解析

设`f(i)`表示`[0,i](0<=i<n-1)`区间的最大利润，`s(i)`为`[i,n-1](0<=i<n)`区间的最大利润，然后求两个函数之和的最大值。

####代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int len=prices.size();
        if(len<=1) return 0;
        vector<int> first(len,0);
        vector<int> second(len,0);
        int left=prices[0];
        int right=prices[len-1];
        for(int i=1;i<len;++i)
        {
            left=min(left,prices[i]);
            first[i]=max(first[i-1],prices[i]-left);
        }
        for(int i=len-2;i>=0;--i)
        {
            right=max(right,prices[i]);
            second[i]=max(second[i+1],right-prices[i]);
        }
        int res=0;
        for(int i=0;i<len;++i)
        {
            res=max(res,first[i]+second[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
