### 121.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

#### 解析

动态规划。`m[j]`为第 j+1 位的最大利润，如果`prices[j]`值比上一位`prices[j-1]`的值小，说明该位的最大利润会减小，减少值为值的差，但是最小不会少于0，所以可以列出动态规划的方程为：

```c++
m[0] = 0;
m[j] = (m[j-1] + prices[j] - prices[j-1]) > 0? m[j-1] + prices[j] - prices[j-1] : 0;
```

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if(prices.empty()) return 0;
        int len = prices.size();
        vector<int> m(len, 0);
        m[0] = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<len;++i)
        {
            int tmp = m[i-1] + prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            m[i] = tmp > 0 ? tmp:0;
            if(m[i] > res)
                res = m[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
