### 127.Word Ladder

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.

**Note:**

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

#### 解析

广度优先搜索，每次扫描当初层数，将当前字符串相邻并存在List中的所有字符串放到下一层（用队列）。

#### 代码

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        if(wordList.empty()) return 0;
        unordered_set<string> MySet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
        queue<string> MyQueue;
        MyQueue.push(beginWord);
        int res = 1;
        while(!MyQueue.empty())
        {
            int CurLen = MyQueue.size();
            for(int i=0;i<CurLen;++i)
            {
                string word = MyQueue.front();
                MyQueue.pop();
                if(word == endWord)
                {
                    return res;
                }
                MySet.erase(word);
                for(int j=0;j<word.size();++j)
                {
                    char c = word[j];
                    for(int k=0;k<26;++k)
                    {
                        word[j] = 'a'+ k;
                        if(MySet.find(word) != MySet.end())
                        {
                            MyQueue.push(word);
                        }
                    }
                    word[j] = c;
                }
            }
            res++;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
