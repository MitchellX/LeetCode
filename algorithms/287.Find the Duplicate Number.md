### 287.Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, *O*(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than *O*(*n*2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size()-1;
        int low = 0, high = n;
        int mid, count;
        while(low < high) {
            mid = (high - low) / 2 + low;
            count = 0;
            for(int num : nums){
                if(num<=mid) count++;
            }
            if(count > mid) high = mid;
            else low = mid+1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
