### 122.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

#### 解析

1. 可以采用和上一题类似的解法，只是遇到减少的数值`m[i]`就清0。
2. 根据规律，可以看出就是求递增数列的和。

#### 代码

动态规划：

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if(prices.empty()) return 0;
        int len = prices.size();
        vector<int> m(len, 0);
        m[0] = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<len;++i)
        {
            if(prices[i] <= prices[i-1])
            {
                m[i] = 0;
                res+=m[i-1];
                continue;
            }
            m[i] = m[i-1] + prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        }
        //针对最后一段单增的处理
        if(m[len-1]>0) res+=m[len-1];
        return res;
    }
};
```

解法2：

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if(prices.empty()) return 0;
        int res = 0;
        int len = prices.size();
        for(int i = 1;i<len;++i)
        {
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1])
                res+=prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
